<h1> Scooby Doo </h1>
<hr></hr>
<p>Scooby-Doo is an American animated cartoon franchise, comprising several animated television series produced from 1969 to the present day. The original series, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, was created for Hanna-Barbera Productions by writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears in 1969. This Saturday-morning cartoon series featured four teenagers : Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley and Norville "Shaggy" Rogers and their talking brown Great Dane dog named Scooby-Doo, who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps</p>
<p>Following the success of the original series, Hanna-Barbera and its successor Warner Bros. Animation have produced numerous follow-up and spin-off animated series and several related works, including television specials and telefilms, a line of direct-to-video films, and two Warner Bros.â€“produced theatrical feature films. Some versions of Scooby-Doo feature different variations on the show's supernatural theme, and include characters such as Scooby's cousin Scooby-Dum and nephew Scrappy-Doo in addition to or instead of some of the original characters.</p>
<p>Scooby-Doo was originally broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1976, when it moved to ABC. ABC aired the show until cancelling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, from 1988 until 1991. Two new Scooby-Doo series, What's New, Scooby-Doo? and Shaggy and Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!, aired as part of Kids WB on The WB network and its successor, The CW network, from 2002 until 2008. The most recent Scooby-Doo series, Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2013.  Repeats of the various Scooby-Doo series are broadcast frequently on Cartoon Network and Boomerang in the United States as well as other countries.</p>
